# Sweek
Sweek is a Ferris/sweep inspired, 36 keys split keyboard.

The K in the name comes from it using [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware).

It features:
- Reversible PCB with through holes diodes for easy soldering.
- RP2040 as MCU.
- Support for MX, choc V1/V2 and Redragon low profile switches (I only tested MX and Redragon LP).
- EC11 encoders and oled displays.
- Communication is through USB-C (using a pair of small USB-C boards available, since I wanted as easiest to solder as possible).
- There is also a diodeless version.

Please see the [Building guide for v1.0.1](./src/buildingguide_v101.org).
