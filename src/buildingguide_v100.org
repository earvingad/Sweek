#+title: Sweek v 1.0.0 building guide

Please do not consider this board suitable for beginners, you need some experience soldering as you will need to solder some jumpers. However, it is not difficult to solder. I recommend using enameled wire of 0.2-0.5 mm.

The board is reversible, but it needs to solder some jumpers for both sides to work correctly. I tried to avoid pin remapping in software as much as possible, but this means that jumpers need to be soldered differently in each side.

* Sweek with encoders and oled
** USB-C board, encoder and oled display
The communication is through an USB-C board like [[https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005005187678366.html][this]]. The reason I chose this is because it is cheap and it is easy to solder.

Encoder height recommendation:
- For low profile switches use 10-12 mm tall EC11 enconders.
- For MX swiches use 15 mm tall EC11 encoders.

Follow this picture as reference of how jumpers must solder:

Use insulated tape to cover wires when needed. For example, in the right side, I would solder first Rx to D- and in order to avoid shorts, I would cover the jumper (Rx to D-) with insoulation tape and then procced to solder the 5.5 V jumper.

** 3.3v ONLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE
Solder the jumper located on the MCU position (JP1). This will serve to route 3.3 V to the right oled display.

** MCU
In both sides, the RP2040 must always be facing up. This is how the PCB was designed in order to have the RGB led available as layer indicator and easy access to buttons for hard reset and enter boot mode.

Please be aware that pin 2 (GP2) is never in use, so *DO NOT SOLDER PIN 2 (GP2) OF THE RP2040 TO THE BOARD*.
** Diodes orientation
Solder diodes to the board. The board has printed the orientation, but take the following picture as reference. Ignore the board (I know it is not a RP2040 in the picture, I was experimenting).

** Pin mapping
This is how pins are assigned to the columns and rows for each side:

Left side:
- Rows: GP29, GP28, GP27, GP26.
- Columns: GP3, GP4, GP5, GP6, GP7.

Right side:
- Rows: GP3, GP4, GP5, GP6.
- Columns: GP29, GP28, GP27, GP26, GP15.

Both sides:
- Encoder: GP10, GP9
- Encoder switch: GP11

Both sides:
- Oled SDA: GP12
- Oled SCL: GP13
* Diodeless version
** JUMPER ONLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE
Solder the jumper located on the MCU position (JP1). This route the pin 2 (GP2) to switch-18 on the right side.

** USB-C board
Solder according to the following picture.

** MCU
Solder every pin of the MCU (RP2040) except the 3.3 V pin.
** Pin to switch mapping
In both sides GP0 (TX) and GP1 (RX) are reserved for communication.
