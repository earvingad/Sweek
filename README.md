It features:
- Reversible PCB with through holes diodes for easy soldering.
- RP2040 as MCU.
- Support for MX, choc V1/V2 and Redragon low profile switches (I only tested MX and Redragon LP).
- EC11 encoders and oled displays.
- Communication is through USB-C (using a pair of small USB-C boards available, since I wanted as easiest to solder as possible).
- There is also a diodeless version.
